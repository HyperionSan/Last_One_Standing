1. Purpose

This thorn contains an implementation of Einstein's
equations of general relativity written in the BSSN
initial value problem (3+1) formulation. In particular
it encodes both the right-hand sides of the BSSN
equations as well as the Hamiltonian and momentum
constraint equations in finite-difference form.

The Baikal thorn includes the T^{\mu\nu} source terms
within the BSSN right-hand sides and constraint
equations, and BaikalVacuum does not. Thus the latter
thorn should be used in vacuum (e.g., black hole or
binary black hole) spacetimes, and the former in
the context of more generic (e.g., single or
binary neutron star) spacetimes.

Encoding the equations into highly optimized C code
was provided courtesy the NRPy+ ("Python-based code
generation for Numerical Relativity... and beyond!")
Python code generation package, which itself depends
upon SymPy for symbolic algebra. Ken Sible is
responsible for many of the low-level optimizations
that have helped the BaikalVacuum & Baikal thorns
perform exceptionally well on modern-day,
SIMD-capable CPUs.

2. Documentation

Full documentation may be found in the NRPy+
Jupyter notebook tutorial:
* Tutorial-ETK_thorn-BaikalETK.ipynb
which is part of the NRPy+ source code on github.

The latest version of the above notebook is located
in the Baikal/doc/ directory.

The notebooks also generate clickable LaTeX'ed versions
   of themselves, and compile the LaTeX into PDFs.

3. Example parameter file

Example parameter files used in validating BaikalVacuum
(comparing against the trusted ML_BSSN thorn) may be found
in par/

4. Regenerating these thorns

Baikal and BaikalVacuum can be automatically generated via

pip install sympy==1.11
git clone https://github.com/zachetienne/nrpytutorial.git
cd nrpytutorial
git checkout 2db34a6ffd41d38133d5c768216ce70574268796
cd BaikalETK
make

from within the nrpytutorial/ directory, where again
nrpytutorial may be downloaded from:
https://github.com/zachetienne/nrpytutorial
The thorns themselves will be output to

BaikalETK/Baikal
and
BaikalETK/BaikalVacuum

5. Special acknowledgements

Thanks to the writers of the McLachlan and Lean BSSN thorns,
which provided many good ideas in the writing of Baikal
and BaikalVacuum.

Thanks also to Roland Haas for answering many implementation
questions and providing valuable insights and advice.

Finally, thanks to Helvi Witek for reviewing this thorn and
helping the authors understand and appreciate Lean even more.
