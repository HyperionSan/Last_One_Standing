Thorn to help link against the Kadath library.  
The Kadath library can be downloaded and compiled separately or built during
the ETK build procedure! 

See https://kadath.obspm.fr/fuka/ for manual installation instructions to do so  
Once compiled, you need to set KADATH_DIR in your OptionList (e.g. KADATH_DIR = ${HOME_KADATH})
