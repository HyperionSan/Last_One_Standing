  type, extends(ode_equation) :: osc_schw
  !! A class that defines the osculating orbit evolution equations for a
  !! particle !! moving in a Schwarzschild spacetime.
  !!
  !! For this system [[osc_schw:nvars]]=6. The quantities stored in
  !! [[osc_schw:var_data]] are 1: \(\chi\), 2: \(\phi\), 3: \(p\),
  !! 4: \(\alpha\), 5: \(\beta\), 6: \(m_q\), where \(\chi\) is a variable
  !! that varies from \(0\) to \(2\pi\) over a full radial cycle, \(\phi\) is
  !! the azimuthal angle, \(p\) is the semi-latus rectum, \(\alpha=e\sin(w)\),
  !! \(\beta=e\cos(w)\) and \(m_q\) is the mass of the scalar charge. The
  !! quantities \(e\) and \(w\) are defined below. Note that \(m_q\) is
  !! stricly constant for all other cases than a scalar charge
  !! and should stricly not be included in a generic geodesic evolution.

    real(wp) :: Lz
