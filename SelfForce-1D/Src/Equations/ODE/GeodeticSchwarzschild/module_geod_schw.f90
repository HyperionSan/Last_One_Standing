  type, extends(ode_equation) :: geod_schw
  !! A class that defines the geodesic evolution equations for a particle
  !! moving in a Schwarzschild spacetime.
  !!
  !! For this system [[geod_schw:nvars]]=7. The quantities stored in
  !! [[geod_schw:var_data]] are 1: \(r\), 2: \(\phi\), 3: \(u^t\),
  !! 4: \(u^r\), 5: \(u^{\phi}\), 6: \(m_q\), 7: \(\chi\), where
  !! \(r\) is the radial coordinate in Schwarzschild coordinates, \(\phi\)
  !! is the azimuthal angle,
  !! \(u^t, u^r\) and \(u^{\phi}\) are the time, radial and \(\phi\)
  !! components of the 4-velocity, \(m_q\) is the mass of the scalar charge
  !! and \(\chi\) s a variable defined in the osculating orbits
  !! framework that varies from \(0\) to \(2\pi\) over a full radial cycle.
  !! Note that \(m_q\) is stricly constant for all other cases than a
  !! scalar charge and should stricly not be included in a generic geodesic
  !! evolution. Also \(\chi\) is included for convenience as it is useful to
  !! control the turn on of the back-reaction in terms of timescales related
  !! to the radial cycle.
    real(wp) :: En
    !! The orbital energy per unit mass.
    real(wp) :: Lz
    !! The orbital angular momentum per unit mass.
    real(wp) :: e
    !! The orbital eccentricity.
    real(wp) :: p
    !! The orbital semi-latus rectum.
    real(wp) :: w
    !! The value of \(\chi\) at periapsis.
    real(wp) :: d2rdt2
    !! The second time derivative of the radial coordinate. Needed for the
    !! time dependent coordinate transformation.
    real(wp), dimension(4) :: force
    !! The self-force or any external force \(f_{\mu}\).
    real(wp), dimension(4) :: accel
    !! The acceleration \(a^{\mu}=
    !!   \frac{q}{m_q}(g^{\mu\nu}+u^{\mu}u^{\nu})f_{\nu}\).
    real(wp) :: udota
    !! The dot-product of the 4-velocity and the force \(q\, u^{\mu}f_{\mu}\).
